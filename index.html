			<p>
				The 2017 BEST Robotics theme is Crossfire, which focusses on the aspect of fires and firefighters. For this competition, each team must design a robot that is capable of rescuing a person and delivering them to a safe environment, ridding of toxic waste, and putting out a fire. The game field consists of three different zones: the hot zone, cold zone, and the no entry zone.
			</p>

			<span id="hot-zone"><b>Hot Zone:</b></span>
			<p>
				The hot zone surrounds the no entry zone and is divided into four other areas, and each of these is accessible by a designated team. In each of these hot zones, Manny the distressed Manikin is on the left and must be saved by the team’s robot and placed in a safe area in the cold zone for 120 points. The teams are also offered 180 bonus points subtracted by the time taken in seconds to rescue him.	
			</p>

			<span id="cold-zone"><b>Cold Zone:</b></span>
			<p>
				The cold zone lines the perimeter of the hot zone, and contains the starting boxes, chemical drums, and containment area. In the cold zone, three chemical drums of different weights must be moved to touch the bottom of the containment area in the cold zone at the end of the match to gain 120 points or 40 points for each chemical drum. There is also a water hydrant that stores the water at the beginning of the match.
			</p>

			<span id="no-entry-zone"><b>No Entry Zone:</b></span>
			<p>
				The no entry zone is a 6’x6’x5’ building in the center of the field which has collapsed because of the fire. The direct result of this is an unstable structure and flaming debris all over the place. Because of the extreme heat and unstable structure, it is a no entry zone that robots cannot travel or reach within. Each of the teams is designated a section of the flames to put out. The flames are simulated by multicolored plastic cups with each color designated for a specific team to put out. Each team will have 30 flames to put out and each are worth 5 points each. If all 30 flames are extinguished--completely knocked over--they receive the “Under Control Bonus” worth 30 points.

			<h2 class="header">History</h2>
			<p>
				Our club was founded many years ago, back before any of our current members were at Westwood. Ancient records revealed that at this time in our history the Westwood Robotics Club had participated actively in the early years of the BEST robotics competition, although we do not know much else. Just like many great civilizations before it, suddenly the club and its glory vanished, leaving very little behind.	
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2007 Collin Buchan and Eric Wood joined up to resurrect the club, determined to keep it from fading away ever again. Before long many other students started following them, and within the first month they had the manpower they needed to realize their vision of the club's future. Harnessing the finest brainpower Westwood had to offer, we were once again on track, taking on the annual BEST challenge in stride. But that only served to fan the flames of our passion for robotics, and before long we were hungry for more action.	
			</p>

			<p>
				The club evolved into a powerful engineering force almost overnight, and the very next year Westwood students ascended to the next level by qualifying for the Texas BEST championships. In the years following, a group of students who had learned under these two passionate revisionists continued out their legacy, even though they had both graduated. Westwood robotics has continued to qualify for the Texas BEST championships since then, currently for four, going on five, consecutive years. This dynastic success comes regardless of the hardships the club has suffered, including strife within the school causing several switches in teacher-sponsors and constant relocations of the club’s arsenal of tools.	
			</p>

			<p>
				We have continued to hold our dynastic success, and have continued to win several 1st place BEST awards in the past years and look forward to many more in the future. We are always striving to improve ourselves and be the best Westwood has to offer.
