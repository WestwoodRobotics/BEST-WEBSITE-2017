		<h2> About Us </h2>

		<img src="team.jpg">
		<p>
			The Westwood Robotics team is made up of a diverse set of students all striving toward the same goal, to inspire new opportunities through technology.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our team consists of students of all grade levels, from freshmen to seniors. Westwood Robotics members come from various backgrounds, and we are an ethnically diverse team.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our members have a wide range of interests; including band, orchestra, dance, soccer, lacrosse, swimming and everything else in between. Our club is supported by a large parent network and mentor system. Our mentors and parents are more to us than just chaperones; they offer guidance and act as our support system and as instructors. To say the least, the Westwood Robotics team is a group of intelligent individuals with great potential.
		</p>

		<p>
			But Westwood Robotics is not a team. We are a family. Many of our members see robotics as a second home, spending a majority of their time learning and working at robotics, while still managing to find time to do homework and persue their wide range of interests. Our members are not just devoted to building a functioning robot and winning awards. Those are by-products of the real goal behind our team – to introduce and immerse STEM principles into the future of our world – the next generation, while having fun in a safe manner.
		</p>

		<h2> Our History </h2>
		<p>
			Our club was founded many years ago, back before any of our current members were at Westwood. Our past teams have participated actively in BEST since the beginning years our club. BEST is how we were able to form student advocates and leaders along with building a strong foundation for future years to come. Our team is a student led and mentor supervised team. We rely on our more experienced members to train and teach the newer members.	
		</p>

		<p>
			The club has evolved into a powerful engineering force over the years, and Westwood robotics has continued to qualify for the Texas BEST championships , currently for four  consecutive years. This dynastic success comes regardless of the hardships the club has suffered, including strife within the school causing several switches in teacher-sponsors and constant relocations of the club’s arsenal of tools. We have continued to hold our ongoing success, and have continued to win several 1st place BEST awards in the past years and look forward to many more in the future. We are always striving to improve ourselves and be the best Westwood has to offer.

		<h2> Competition </h2>

		<p>
			The 2017 BEST Robotics theme is Crossfire, which focusses on the aspect of fires and firefighters. For this competition, each team must design a robot that is capable of rescuing a person and delivering them to a safe environment, ridding of toxic waste, and putting out a fire. The game field consists of three different zones: the hot zone, cold zone, and the no entry zone.
		</p>

		<div id="hot-zone">
			<div class="useless-padding ghost"></div>
			<h4> Hot Zone </h4>
			<p>
				The hot zone surrounds the no entry zone and is divided into four other areas, and each of these is accessible by a designated team. In each of these hot zones, Manny the distressed Manikin is on the left and must be saved by the team’s robot and placed in a safe area in the cold zone for 120 points. The teams are also offered 180 bonus points subtracted by the time taken in seconds to rescue him.	
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="cold-zone">	
			<div class="useless-padding ghost"></div>
			<h4> Cold Zone </h4>
			<p>
				The cold zone lines the perimeter of the hot zone, and contains the starting boxes, chemical drums, and containment area. In the cold zone, three chemical drums of different weights must be moved to touch the bottom of the containment area in the cold zone at the end of the match to gain 120 points or 40 points for each chemical drum. There is also a water hydrant that stores the water at the beginning of the match.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="no-entry-zone"> 
			<div class="useless-padding ghost"></div>
			<h4> No Entry Zone </h4>
			<p>
				The no entry zone is a 6'x6'x5' building in the center of the field which has collapsed because of the fire. The direct result of this is an unstable structure and flaming debris all over the place. Because of the extreme heat and unstable structure, it is a no entry zone that robots cannot travel or reach within. Each of the teams is designated a section of the flames to put out. The flames are simulated by multicolored plastic cups with each color designated for a specific team to put out. Each team will have 30 flames to put out and each are worth 5 points each. If all 30 flames are extinguished--completely knocked over--they receive the "Under Control Bonus" worth 30 points.

		<h2> Robot Design </h2>
		<p>
			Before we started designing the robot, we first analyzed the potential points we could earn from each obstacle. After discussing and voting as a team, we decided to create mechanisms for saving Manny, putting out the fire, and removing the chemical drum on the top of the stack. Then, we split up into groups to design a valid solution to an assigned obstacle, and shared each idea once completed. Once we voted upon the best designs for each challenge we would have to complete, we separated into groups once more and built the planned mechanisms under the supervision of our club president and mentors.

			<h2> Robot Functions </h2>

			<div id="saving-manny"> 
				<div class="useless-padding ghost"></div>
				<h4> Saving Manny </h4>
				<p>
					In order to move Manny to his designated safe spot, we built an arm that has one degree of rotation on the x-axis. The arm is made using a sprocket and belt system and a motor that determines the height of a wooden bar that is extended by two PVC pipes. By moving the wooden bar upwards and downwards, the robot now has the ability to push and pull Manny to wherever he needs to go.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="putting-out-fire">
				<div class="useless-padding ghost"></div>
				<h4> Putting Out the Fire </h4>
				<p>
					Our team constructed a catapult that launches the water at the fire to put it out. We were able to do this by using a servo that pulls back the catapult and stretches a bungee cord. When the bungee is released, so is the water. When the robot is correctly aligned and aimed at the fire, the water will successfully be able to put out the fire.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="chemical-drums">
				<div class="useless-padding ghost"></div>
				<h4> Collecting The Chemical Drums </h4>
				<p>
				    After considering the possible designs we could use to pick up the chemical drums, we decided that only picking up the top can by using a claw. This mechanism works like a pair of scissors by only using string, a motor, and two claws. The motor will wind the string to close the claw, and unwind the string to open it.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="driving">
				<div class="useless-padding ghost"></div>
				<h4> Driving </h4>
				<p>
					Our robot uses two 12-inch wheels located in the back of the robot base. These wheels are controlled by two motors for power, and skids for balance. The skids were designed to gently bounce the robot in order to ensure that none of the robot components and attachments are put out of place or ruined.
